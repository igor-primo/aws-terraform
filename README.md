# AWS Terraform

This repository documents my progress
in a Terraform + AWS course.

## Attention

In order to manager software dependencies,
this project uses Nix build manager wrapped inside devenv. Nix allow the creation of ad-hoc shell environments exposing the necessary software in a declarative and truly reproducible manner, installing the software if not yet installed.

This use idiosyncrasy of mine should not trouble you. Just make sure the referred software in devenv.nix is installed.

To see more about this, please refer [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) and [nix](https://nix.dev/).
